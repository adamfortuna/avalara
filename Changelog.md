# 0.0.2 - May 7, 2012 - Updated tests for test endpoint.

Looks like the tests were initally run against the production database
(whops). I re-ran them against test and they're still working.
No code changes for this, other than documenting the test endpoint.

# 0.0.1 - February 3, 2012 - Initial Release with get_tax call

Not much in the way of features so far, but the rough draft of the get_tax call is in,
as well as error and warning message handling. Still need to update the docs with it
once an API to the gem is finalized.
